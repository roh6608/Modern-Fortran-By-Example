# Modern-Fortran-By-Example
A repository containing the code found in the set of videos by hexafoil at https://www.youtube.com/user/hexafoil. Note that I did note write this code, this repository is just a compilation of the code written by hexafoil, I would highly recommend watching the series of videos hexafoil produced as they explain  modern Fortran in a clear and succint manner.
